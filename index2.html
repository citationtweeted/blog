    These writings reflect my spontaneous, sometimes undeveloped thoughts at the time of posting. My beliefs change over time, and so should yours. Decades from now, I may look back at this blog and grimace at what I once thought to be truths. To spare future-me from the judgements of others, I keep this blog anonymous. Occasionally, I go back and expand on a thought or fix a typo, but mostly I prefer to let my past work sit there, for better or worse. If you really want to dig in and see which of my posts have changed, there's always the Internet Archive, or [github](https://github.com/citationtweeted/blog).
