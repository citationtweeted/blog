<h1>Link: &quot;Glenn Greenwald, the Bane of Their Resistance&quot;</h1> <p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/03/glenn-greenwald-the-bane-of-their-resistance">Very interesting and nuanced look at Glenn Greenwald.</a> As someone who respects his disdain for the status quo of American political institutions, but also dislikes how his methods of presentation seem dangerous considering his audiences on Twitter of Fox &quot;News&quot; apply less nuance and perspective than he does, I quite enjoyed Ian Parker's profile.</p> <p>I agree with the need to be skeptical when there's clearly an urge to blame everything on Russia. I also think there's a lot of evidence of collusion and corruption on Trump's part. I do agree that there's plenty of power abuse on the left and the right in the US, but both-sides-ism masks the very real and unique threats Trump brings—certainly, he's disrupting the existing shitfest but only by pouring out his own diarrhea dump. And yes, much of this is the same brand of terror the US has unleashed upon other nations before, but I don't like it when we do it either. And if we return to a post-Trump state of &quot;normal&quot; it is unfortunate that the Democratic Party will revert to its usual shitty ways. But because they are still so much less shitty than the other mainstream options, just tearing everybody down with both-sides-ism when the worse side has a strong grip without also putting twice as much effort into promoting real left wing candidates and policies is just rolling dice.</p>
